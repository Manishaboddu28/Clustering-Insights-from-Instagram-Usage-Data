# 📊 Clustering Insights from Instagram Usage Data
# 🧠 Project Overview
This project explores unsupervised learning through clustering techniques on Instagram user visit patterns. The goal is to uncover hidden behavior patterns, group similar users, and derive actionable marketing insights using clustering algorithms like K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering.

# 📁 Dataset Description
The dataset represents various features related to Instagram user activity such as:

Visit frequency

Time spent

Interaction metrics (likes/comments)

Demographics (if any)

It is cleaned, normalized, and preprocessed to suit clustering models.

# 🎯 Objectives
Segment Instagram users based on usage patterns.

Compare different clustering models and determine optimal cluster count.

Visualize user clusters to derive business and marketing insights.

# 🛠️ Techniques & Tools
Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Algorithms Used:

K-Means Clustering

Hierarchical Clustering

Elbow Method & Dendrograms for cluster selection

Evaluation Tools:

Silhouette Score

Visual Plots (2D Cluster Representations)

# 📌 Key Findings
Optimal number of clusters determined using the Elbow method.

User behavior patterns became distinctly observable post clustering.

Each cluster indicates a unique user group—power users, moderate users, and casual visitors.

# 📷 Visual Insights
2D Plots showing clusters.

Dendrogram for hierarchical understanding of user groups.

# 🧩 Use Cases
Targeted Marketing based on user group behavior.

User retention strategies for under-engaged clusters.

Influencer identification from power-user clusters.
